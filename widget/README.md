# Sykkelveier.no Widget

Based on a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with hot module reloading and some ESLint rules.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To build the widget:

```bash
bun run build
# bundle.js is the widget that one can use via a <script> tag
# FIXME: Document how to use when the widget API is ready
```

To run devserver:

```bash
bun run dev
```
